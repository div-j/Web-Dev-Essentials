### **Cirrhosis Clinical Summary**  
*(Ignatavicius et al., 2024, Chapter 59)*  

| **Category**          | **Details** |  
|-----------------------|------------|  
| **Normal Physiology** | The liver metabolizes nutrients, detoxifies blood, produces clotting factors, and secretes bile. Hepatocytes regenerate after injury. |  
| **Significant Changes** | Hepatitis B and hepatitis D are the most common causes of cirrhosis worldwide.  Cirrhosis may also occur due to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Another common cause of cirrhosis is excessive and prolonged alcohol use.|  
| **Signs/Symptoms** |  symptoms of this complication include sleep disturbance, mood disturbance, mental status changes, and speech problems. Hepatic encephalopathy may be reversible with early intervention. Later neurologic symptoms include an altered level of consciousness, impaired thinking processes, and neuromuscular problems. |  
| **Lab/Diagnostic** | Elevated AST/ALT (AST > ALT), hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, prolonged PT/INR, thrombocytopenia. Ultrasound shows nodular liver. |  
| **Medications** | Diuretics (spironolactone + furosemide), lactulose (for encephalopathy), beta-blockers (portal HTN), rifaximin. |  
| **Plan of Care** | Sodium restriction (<2 g/day), moderate protein, paracentesis for refractory ascites, and liver transplant evaluation. |  
| **Interventions** | Monitor for GI bleeding (varices), assess mental status daily, measure abdominal girth, protect against falls (encephalopathy). |  
| **Complications** | Acute spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), Esophageal varices, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatocellular carcinoma |

### **B-cell Lymphoma Clinical Summary**  
*(Ignatavicius et al., 2024, Chapter 64)*  

| **Category**          | **Details** |  
|-----------------------|------------|  
| **Normal Physiology** | B-lymphocytes produce antibodies and mature in lymph nodes/spleen. Apoptosis removes abnormal cells. |  
| **Significant Changes** | Malignant B-cells proliferate uncontrollably, forming tumors in lymph nodes/organs. Subtypes include DLBCL, follicular, and mantle cell lymphoma. |  
| **Signs/Symptoms** | Painless lymphadenopathy, "B symptoms" (fever, night sweats, weight loss), fatigue, splenomegaly. |  
| **Lab/Diagnostic** | Excisional lymph node biopsy (gold standard), CBC (cytopenias), LDH (prognostic), PET/CT for staging. |  
| **Medications** | R-CHOP regimen (rituximab + cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone), CAR-T therapy (refractory cases). |  
| **Plan of Care** | Chemo/immunotherapy, radiation for localized disease, stem cell transplant (high-risk cases). |  
| **Interventions** | Monitor for tumor lysis syndrome (post-chemo), prevent infections (neutropenia), manage nausea (antiemetics). |  
| **Complications** | Infection, secondary cancers, chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy (doxorubicin). |  

**Key Point**: *Ann Arbor staging* determines treatment (p. 1498).

### **Sepsis Clinical Summary**  
*(Ignatavicius et al., 2024, Chapter 66)*  

| **Category**          | **Details** |  
|-----------------------|------------|  
| **Normal Physiology** | The immune system eliminates pathogens via localized inflammation. Cytokines are regulated to prevent systemic damage. |  
| **Significant Changes** | Dysregulated host response to infection causes widespread endothelial injury, microthrombi, and organ hypoperfusion. |  
| **Signs/Symptoms** | Signs and symptoms of sepsis include a lower oxygen saturation, a rapid respiratory rate, decreased or absent urine output, and a change in the patient’s cognition and affects. |  
| **Lab/Diagnostic** | blood glucose levels (>180 mg/dL or >10 mmol/L), Lactate ≥2 mmol/L, WBC >12k or <4k, procalcitonin (infection marker), blood cultures, SOFA score ≥2. |  
| **Medications** | Use of V hydrocortisone and oral udrocortisone drugs. Oxygen therapy, Blood replacement therapy, Prophylaxis therapy and early initiation of nutrition|  
| **Plan of Care** | Evaluate patients, Use aseptic technique during invasive procedures and when working with nonintact skin and mucous membranes in patients. Remove indwelling urinary catheters and IV access lines when no longer needed. Ensure patients receiving mechanical ventilation are weaned from the ventilator as soon as possible, antibiotics within 1 hour, source control (e.g., drain abscess).  |  
| **Interventions** | Monitor urine output (target >0.5 mL/kg/hr), prevent ARDS (low tidal volume ventilation), DVT prophylaxis. |  
| **Complications** | Tissue damage, organ failure, and death if not treated promptly and appropriately. |
